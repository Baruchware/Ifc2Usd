# Ifc2Usd
 Repository used to convert IFC files to USD
 Python 3.10
 In order to make it work you have to install the ifcopenshell package for python

 # TO DO:
 * Create an option which create a flat hierarchy, but with an empty USD prim which contains an attribute containing the IFC Hierarchy (maybe will be definitive and replace the current hierarchy management)
 * Test more IFC files with textures in order to improve the current behavior
 * Create lights where there are IFC Lights
 * Manage all measure units for the object properties
